#For more information and the latest release: http://www.brentozar.com/go/querystack
#Imported from the Stack Exchange Data Dump circa 2010: https://archive.org/details/stackexchange

#This database is in Microsoft SQL Server 2008 format,
#which means you can attach it to any SQL Server 2008 or newer instance.

#To keep the size small but let you get started fast:
#* All tables have a clustered index
#* No nonclustered or full text indexes are included
#* The log file is small, and you should grow it out if you plan to modify data
#* It's distributed as an mdf/ldf so you don't need space to restore it
#* It only includes StackOverflow.com data, not data for other Stack sites
